There have been some issues during the debugging process which have led to failure. 

Please check the following items:

1) Ensure that the image directory in the source package contains disk1.vhd and disk2.vhd, and that each file is approximately 50MB in size. These two are disk image files, and their absence will cause debugging to fail. 

2) Try starting VSCode as an administrator. This is because some system commands are used, and some versions of Windows have strict permissions checks. To do this, find VSCode in the Start menu, right-click it, and choose to run as an administrator.

If you can not find the disk or the problem still cannot be resolved, reach me via h3sun@uwaterloo.ca.
